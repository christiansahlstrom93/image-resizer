# reactjs-image-resizer

Widget for resizing and rotating images, for React applications. The widget is fully customisable when it comes to styling. Just pass in a **className** as a prop with your styling. Check our [documentation](https://algobook.info/docs/image-resizer) for more examples and information.

Select an image from your local disk, and start editing. When you are done, click on **Resize** button and the image will call our own **API** that will resize the image and provide a download link.

## Free API
If you want to implement your own solution, we have a free API that you can utilize instead. Read more [here](https://algobook.info/docs/image-resizer-api)
